#Understanding the basics of what different types of ingredients do to dough

##Things I have been thinking about

* Do I want to continue using chemical leaveners?
* What are really great egg substitutes? Flax seed?
* How much is too processed? (Iâ€™d like to keep it to things that could be made at home, if you had a reasonable set of tools, but might prefer to buy fresh from the store, e.g. Almond Milk that is only almonds and water)
* Can you use carbonated water as a leavener? Beer?
