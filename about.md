#A journey through baking with ratios and learning how to think like a vegan

I have never really gotten into baking because I am too much of a fiddler. I don’t think in lists, and I like to play. Cooking for me has always been a place for play and experiment. It is like that feeling I get when I am designing a screen in photoshop or editing pictures or working on a craft or sanding a table. It is tweaking and feeling and emotion and play that gets me where I am going and makes me happy. And cooking like this has worked for me historically. I have taught myself to be a halfway decent cook by trying to understand how ingredients work and what the basics of cooking technique are. There is nothing more fun than the mental maps coming together where it turns out that braising and roasting and grilling and sauteing and all those techniques are all just on a continuum. That if you understand the science of what is going on then you can do way more than you think you “know” how to do. And by science, I mean listening to tons of Americas Test Kitchen and reading How to Cook Everything. No bachelors degree required. 

So most of the cooking that I do now involves trying new ingredients in new combinations. My favorite way of cooking is Chopped style. Where you are given totally random ingredients and have to figure out how the puzzle fits. And it will, it’s like tetris or something. Plus you can always make a quesadilla out of almost anything. I love it, even when the results aren’t perfect. I have loved whole foods before I understood the health benefit because I understood that you can use a tomato as a thickener and not just as a topping on a burger. I spent years getting a veggie box because of the variety that it gave me and the way in which it required me to research things and learn about new ingredients. 

So last night I felt like a huge new area was opened for me by the book Ratio. I am not sure why I never bought it before, but it is so up my alley. To take a step back, I completely hate baking. Not hate, its not all like that. I can make a pizza dough or a muffin, but even something as simple as a pancake won’t always work out for me. I burn it or the texture is wrong or something. You can’t fiddle with baking, everyone knows that. So I have always just left baking to everyone else. But back to the book. For me, it completely changed the way I look at everything. I always that thought that to really get into baking I was going to need to really go back and understand the chemistry, and while I am sure that is possible, it just really didn’t seem fun. I just want to make something. I don’t care if it is time-intensive, but I want to still play and build and create and put my own mark on it. And use up that leftover basket of berries or bunch of carrots in the fridge. And yes, I have heard of the internet. 

So I want to explore that continuum that lies between bread and crepes. I want to learn how to make every one of those items and understand the way it is supposed to be at its most basic and then build it up from there. 

But I want to do it vegan. 

I am not personally vegan, although I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years. But there is something incredibly appealing to eating so cleanly and simply as a vegan diet allows. I am not currently interested in becoming 100% vegan, but I do want to be able to bake and I do want to be able to cook delicious vegan food, so I am going to start this experiment together. 

The goal, by the end of it, however long it take is to have one basic vegan recipe for each of the 15 basic baking doughs.

The way I will accomplish it is by first making the absolute most straightforward traditional version of the item that I can. That means high-quality 00 flour and cake flour and whatever else I need. Amazing butter. Great sugar and local farm raised eggs. Make the original ratio. Take notes on what it means to be a “sponge cake” or “bread” and then figure out how to accomplish the same thing but vegan. And not by replacing flour with weird processed ingredients. Keep it high-quality and whole. 

Let’s break bread y’all.
